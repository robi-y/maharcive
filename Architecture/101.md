##Big picture process:
- North star 
- Immediate goal - for first sprint 
	- map data sources 
	- load data - quick and dirty 
	- build a basic model based on Hugging Face â€“ The AI community building the future.
	- show value 
 
	

##Manual POC:
- create s3 bucket 
- create 2 dirs
- load files to dirs.
- connect to Athena 
- create database (declarative only) 
- create tables in Athena mapped on s3 dirs (u can get gen-ai help on create tables) for example by:
	- CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS flights (
		    time DOUBLE,
		    x DOUBLE,
		    y DOUBLE,
		    z DOUBLE
		)
		ROW FORMAT DELIMITED
		FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
		LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
		STORED AS TEXTFILE
		LOCATION 's3://refa-hack1/flights/'
		TBLPROPERTIES (
		    'skip.header.line.count'='1',
		    'serialization.encoding'='UTF-8'
		);
	- use Athena to query the new tables
